This is a team project for Stacks and Queues in C (LIFO,FIFO)
Here we were tasked to come up with a monty bytecode interpreter tha
accepts a file as an argumment, opens the file, read the instructions of the file 
line by line and executes same.
the knowledge of Command line arguments, arrays, singly linked list, doubly linked
list, static and dynamic memory allocation would enable us carry out this project.
